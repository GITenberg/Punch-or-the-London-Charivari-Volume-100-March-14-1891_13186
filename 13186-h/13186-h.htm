    <h2>SPECIMENS FROM MR. PUNCH'S SCAMP-ALBUM.</h2>

    <h3>No. III.&mdash;THE BIOGRAPHER.</h3>

    <p>We will ask you, reader, this week, to compel your fancy to
    take a further flight, and kindly imagine yourself a worthy
    merchant, who has exchanged the turmoil of City-life for the
    elegant leisure of a suburban villa&mdash;let us say at
    Norwood. You are in your dining-room, examining the sky, and
    thinking that, if the weather holds up, you will take your big
    dog out presently for a run before lunch, when you are told
    that a gentleman is in the study who wishes to see you "on
    particular business." The very word excites you, not
    unpleasantly, nor do you care whether it is Churchwarden's
    business, or the District Board, or the County Council&mdash;it
    is enough that your experience and practical knowledge of
    affairs are in request&mdash;and, better still, it will give
    you something to do. So, after a delay due to your own
    importance, you march into your study, and find a brisk
    stranger, with red whiskers and a flexible mouth, absorbed in
    documents which he has brought with him in a black bag.</p>

             alt="'Your Visitor has his Note-book out.'" />
             </a>"Your Visitor has his Note-book out."
    </div>

    <p>"I <i>have</i> the pleasure of addressing Mr. MARK LANE, I
    think?" he says. "Just so. Well, Mr. MARK LANE, I consider
    myself extremely fortunate in finding you at home, I assure
    you, and a very charming place you have here&mdash;abundant
    evidence of a refined and cultivated mind, excellent selection
    of our best-known writers, everything, if I may say so, elegant
    in the extreme&mdash;as was to be expected! Even from the
    cursory glimpse I have had, I can see that your interior would
    lend itself admirably to picturesque description&mdash;which
    brings me to the object of my visit. I have called upon you,
    Mr. LANE, in the hope of eliciting your sympathy and patronage
    for a work I am now compiling&mdash;a work which will, I am
    confident, commend itself to a gentleman of your wide culture
    and interest in literary matters." (<i>Here you will look as
    judicial as you can, and harden your heart in advance against a
    new Encyclopædia, or an illustrated edition of</i> SHAKSPEARE's
    <i>works</i>.) "The work I allude to, Mr. LANE, is entitled,
    <i>Notable Nonentities of Norwood and its Neighbourhood." (Here
    you will nod gravely, rather taken by the title.</i>) "It will
    be published very shortly, by subscription, Mr. LANE, in two
    handsome quarto volumes, got up in the most sumptuous style. It
    is a work which has been long wanted, and which, I venture to
    predict, will be very widely read. It is my ambition to make it
    a complete biographical compendium of every living celebrity of
    note residing at Norwood at the present date. It will be
    embellished with copious illustrations, printed by an entirely
    new process upon India and Japanese paper;
    everything&mdash;type, ink, paper, binding, will be of the best
    procurable; the publishers being determined to spare no expense
    in making it a book of reference superior to anything of the
    kind previously attempted!" (<i>As he pauses fur breath, you
    will take occasion to observe, that no doubt such a work, as he
    contemplates, will be an excellent thing&mdash;but that, for
    your own part, you can dispense with any information respecting
    the Notabilities of Norwood, and, in short, that if he will
    excuse you</i>&mdash;)</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:36%;">

             alt="'You may have to wait.'" /></a>"You may have to
             wait."
    </div>

    <p>"Pardon me, Mr. LANE," he interrupts, "you mistake my
    object. I should not dream of expecting you to <i>subscribe</i>
    to such a work. But, in my capacity of compiler, I naturally
    desire to leave nothing undone that care and research can
    effect to render the work complete&mdash;and it would be
    incomplete indeed, were it to include no reference to so
    distinguished a resident as yourself!" ("<i>Oh,
    pooh&mdash;nonsense!" You will say at this&mdash;but you will
    sit down again</i>) "Norwood is a singularly favoured locality.
    Sir; its charms have induced many of our foremost men to select
    it for their <i>rus in urbe</i>. Why, in this very
    road&mdash;May I ask, by the way, if you are acquainted with
    Alderman MINCING? Alderman MINCING has been good enough to
    furnish me with many interesting details of his personal
    career, a photo-gravured portrait of him will be included, with
    views of the interior and exterior of 'The Drudgeries,' and a
    bit from the back-garden." (<i>You do know</i>
    MINCING&mdash;<i>and you cannot help inwardly wondering at the
    absurd vanity of the man</i>&mdash;<i>a mere nobody, away from
    the City!</i>) "Between ourselves," says your interviewer,
    candidly, having possibly observed your expression, "I am by no
    means sure that I shall feel warranted in allotting Alderman
    MINCING as much space as I fear he will consider himself
    entitled to. Alderman MINCING, though a highly respectable man,
    does <i>not</i> appeal to the popular imagination as others I
    could mention do&mdash;he is just a <i>little</i> commonplace!"
    ("<i>Shrewd follow, this!" you think to yourself&mdash;"Got</i>
    MINCING's <i>measure!</i>") "But I should feel it an honour,
    indeed, if such a man as yourself, now, would give me all the
    personal information you think proper to make public, while, as
    a specimen of what Norwood can do in luxurious and artistic
    domestic fittings, this house, Sir, would be invaluable! I do
    trust that you will see your way to&mdash;" (<i>At first, you
    suggest that you must talk it over with your Wife&mdash;but you
    presently see that if</i> MINCING <i>and men of that calibre
    are to be in this, you cannot, for your own sake, hold aloof,
    and so your Visitor soon has his note-book out.</i>) "Any
    remarkable traits recorded of you as an infant, Mr. LANE? A
    strong aversion to porridge, and an antipathy to
    black-beetles&mdash;both of which you still retain? Thank you,
    <i>very</i> much. And you were educated? At Dulborough Grammar
    School? Just <i>so</i>! Never took to Latin, or learned Greek?
    Commercial aptitudes declaring themselves thus
    early&mdash;curious, <i>indeed</i>! Entered your father's
    office as clerk? Became a partner? Married your present
    lady&mdash;when? In 1860? Exactly!&mdash;and have offspring?
    Your subsequent life comparatively uneventful? That will do
    admirably&mdash;infinitely obliged to you, I am sure. It would
    be useless to ask you if you would care to have a copy of the
    work, when issued, forwarded to you&mdash;we can do it for you
    at the very nominal sum of two guineas, if paid in
    advance&mdash;a gratifying possession for your children after
    you have gone, Mr. LANE! I <i>may</i> put you down? Thank you.
    For <i>two</i> copies?" (<i>On second thoughts, you do order
    two copies; you can send one out to your married Sister in
    Australia</i>&mdash;<i>it will amuse her.</i>) "One, two,
    three, four guineas&mdash;<i>quite</i> correct, Mr. LANE, and
    you shall have an early opportunity of revising a proof, and we
    will send down a competent artist, in a day or two, to take the
    photographs. Quite an agreeable change in the weather, is it
    not? <i>Good</i> day!"</p>

    <p>He is gone, leaving you to wait for the proof, and the
    photographer, and the appearance of that great work. <i>Notable
    Nonentities of Norwood</i>,&mdash;and it is not at all unlikely
    that you may have to wait a considerable time.</p>

    intending Travellers has recently been published, entitled,
    "<i>Where to Stay</i>." It is both ornamental and useful; but
    so much depends on ways and means, that, after careful
    consideration, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, when asked "<i>Where to
    Stay</i>," considers the safest answer will always be, "<i>At
    home</i>."</p>

    <h4>(<i>Extract of Letter from</i> DICKY DIDDLUM, <i>Bookmaker,
    Paris, to</i> BOUNDING BOB, <i>ditto, Newmarket.</i>)</h4>

    <p>"... Our game here appears to be as decidedly <i>hup</i> as
    the top of the Awful Tower! Regular mugs, these Mossoos, after
    all. Thought we <i>had</i> taught 'em a bit about <i>Ler
    Sport</i> by this time: but, bless yer, BOB, once a Pollyvoo,
    always a Pollyvoo! No Frenchy really hunderstands a 'Oss, or
    knows 'ow to make a Book!</p>

    <p>"Abolish Betting!!! Wot next, I wonder? Wot with County
    Councils, dunderheaded Deppyties, and Swells who do the
    Detective bizness in their own droring-rooms, pooty soon there
    won't be a safe look in for a party as wants to do a nice
    little flutter&mdash;unless, of course, he's a Stock-Exchange
    spekkylator, or a hinvester in South American Mines.
    <i>Then</i> he can plunge, and hedge, and jockey the jugginses
    as much as he's a mind to. Wonder how that bloomin' French
    <i>Bourse</i> 'ud get along without a bit o' the pitch-and-toss
    barney, as every man as <i>is</i> a man finds the werry salt of
    life. Yah! This here Moral game is a gettin' played down too
    darned low for anythink. And wot's it mean, arter all? Why, 'No
    Naughtiness, except for the Nobs!' That's about the exact size
    of it, and it's blazing beastly, BOB!</p>

    <p>"Only one of the dashed Deppyties talked a mossel o' sense,
    fur as <i>I</i> see. A certain MOSSOO DER KERJEGU, a
    Republican, too, bless his boko! said as 'races were essential
    to 'orsebreeding, and that without betting there would be no
    races.' O.K. you are, MOSSOO DER K.! And then they up and chuck
    hus Bookies! No bookies, no betting; no betting, no races; no
    racing, no 'osses; no 'osses, no nothink! That's how it runs,
    BOB, or I'm a sossidge!</p>

    <p>"But this here bloomin' Republick is too rediklus for
    anythink. Look at the kiddish kick-up along o' the visit of the
    Hempress! Why, if <i>we</i> 'ad that duffer, DEROULÈDE, on
    Newmarket 'Eath, we should just duck him in a 'orsepond, like a
    copped Welsher. Here they washup him, or else knuckle under to
    him, like a skeery Coster's missus when her old man's on the
    mawl, and feels round arter her ribs with his bloomin'
    high-lows. <i>That's</i> yer high-polite French Artists and
    brave booky-banishin' Dippyties! Yah!</p>

    <p>"'Owsomever, I suppose, BOB, I must clear out of this.
    MOSSOO CONSTANS, he said, 'if the Bill were carried there would
    be an end to bookmakers.' And it <i>was</i> carried, by 340
    mugs against 144 right 'uns. And arter all me and my sort has
    done for Parry! It's mean, that's wot it is, BOB. P'raps
    they'll chuck British <i>jockeys</i> next! Much good their
    <i>Grong Pree</i>, ancetrer, will be <i>then</i>, my boy.
    <i>Our</i> 'osses, <i>our</i> jockeys, <i>and</i> our bookies
    has bin the making of French Sport,&mdash;and werrv nice little
    pickings there's bin out of it take it all round. Wot'll <i>Ler
    Hig Life</i>, and Hart, and Leagues o' Patriots, and miles o'
    bullyvards, and COOK's Tourists and Awful Towers do for Parry
    without <i>hus</i>, I wonder? We shall <i>see</i>! Ah, Madame

    <h2>THE FIRST ACT&mdash;AND THE LAST.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Departmental Tragi-Comedy, in active
    Rehearsal.</i>)</h4>

    <p>ACT I.&mdash;<i>The Scene represents the Interior of a
    Military Instruction Room. Black Boards, on which are displayed
    advanced Problems and Calculations in the Higher Mathematics,
    and various Scientific Charts cover the Walls. Models of
    mechanical contrivances and machinery used in the construction
    of complicated Small Arms approved by the Authorities, are
    scattered about in every direction.</i> TOMMY ATKINS <i>is
    discovered, giving his best attention to the conclusion of a
    very lengthy but rather abstruse explanatory Lecture.</i></p>

    <p><i>Military Instructor</i> (<i>who has been for an hour and
    a half explaining the intricate mechanism of the new Magazine
    Rifle, finally approaching the end of his subject</i>). Well,
    as I have fully explained before, but may state once more, so
    as to firmly impress it on your memory, you will bear in mind
    that the cylindrical portion will be shortened in front, the
    end of the rib being provided with tooth underneath, and stud
    on top, both studs on rib to have undercut grooves, a small
    keeper-screw, and bolt-head for cover, being added, while the
    cocking-stud is enlarged. Then do not forget that jammed cases
    or bullets are removed by two ramrods, screwed together by the
    locking-bolt being omitted. I needn't again go over the
    twenty-four different screws, but, in ease of accident, it will
    be well to retain their various outside thread diameters in
    your memory, specially not forgetting that those of the Butt
    Trap Spring, the Dial Sight Pivot, and the Striker Keeper
    Screw, stand respectively at .1696, .1656, and .116 of an inch.
    Of course you will remember the seven pins, and that, if
    anything should go wrong with the Bolt Head Cover Pin, as you
    will practically have to take the whole rifle to pieces, you
    should be thoroughly familiar with the 197 different component
    items, which, properly adjusted one with the other, make up the
    whole weapon. I think I need not refer again to the "sighting,"
    seeing that the Lewes system is abolished, and that the weapon
    is now sighted up to 3,500 yards, "dead on," no matter what the
    wind may be. With this remark, I have much pleasure in placing
    the rifle in your hands (<i>gives him one</i>), at the same
    time advising you, if called upon to use it in the heat of
    action, to be prepared with the knowledge I have endeavoured to
    impart to you to-day, and, above all things, to keep your head
    cool. I don't think I have anything more to add, ATKINS. I have
    made myself pretty clear?</p>

    <p><i>Tommy Atkins</i> (<i>with a grin</i>). 'Ees, Sir!</p>

    <p><i>Military Instructor</i>. And there is nothing more you
    wish to ask me?</p>

    <p><i>Tommy Atkins</i> (<i>still grinning</i>). Noa, Sir!</p>

    <p><i>Military Instructor</i>. Ah! well then, good morning. I
    trust you will find it, what they assure me it is,&mdash;a most
    serviceable weapon.</p>

    <p>ACT II.&mdash;<i>The Scene represents a Field of Battle
    (after the fight) in the immediate neighbourhood of London.</i>
    TOMMY ATKINS <i>and the</i> Military Instructor <i>discovered
    lying badly wounded amidst a heap of the slain. A European War
    having broken out suddenly, from which the Country could not
    escape, and the Fleet at the last moment, finding that it had
    only half its proper supply of guns, and that the very few of
    these which did not burst at the first shot had ammunition
    provided for them that was two sizes too large, the Country is
    invaded, while a Committee of Experts is still trying to settle
    on a suitable cartridge for the new Magazine Rifle. The result
    is, that after a couple of pitched battles, though in an
    outburst of popular fury</i>, Mr. STANHOPE <i>is lynched by the
    Mob to a lamp-post in Parliament Street, London capitulates,
    and the French Commander-in-Chief, breakfasts, waited on by
    the</i> LORD MAYOR, <i>in the Bank of England.</i></p>

    <p><i>Military Instructor</i> (<i>sitting up and rubbing his
    eyes</i>). Dear me! we seem to have been beaten. That Rifle was
    no good, after all. (<i>Recognising him.</i>) Halloa,

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>SIR EDWIN ARNOLD's paper on Japan, in <i>Scribner</i>, for
    March, is interesting and also amusing. The Japanese seemed to
    be a charming people; and the Japanese women delightful as
    wives; but then they can be divorced for being talkative.</p>

    <p><i>A propos</i> of Japan, to judge from one of our LIKA
    JOKO's capital illustrations of Hospital Nursing in <i>The
    English Illustrated Magazine</i>, the Matron's room must be "an
    illigant place, intoirely"; while as for amusement, if the
    picture of a nurse giving a patient a cup of ink by mistake for
    liquorice-water isn't a real good practical side-splitter, the
    Baron would like to be informed what is? Then we come upon a
    delightful little picture of "<i>The Pet of the Hospital</i>";
    and so she ought to be, for a prettier pet than this nursing
    Sister it would be difficult to find. What becomes of her? Does
    she marry a "Sawbones," or run off with a patient? Anyhow, she
    must be a "great attraction," and if anything were to happen to
    the Baron, and he couldn't be removed to his own palatial
    residence, he would say, "Put me in a cab, drive me to the
    Furniss Hospital, and let me be in Pretty Pet's Ward."</p>

    <p>The Baron has just been dipping into Mr. JUSTIN HUNTLY
    McCARTHY's "Pages on Plays" in <i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>.
    JUSTIN HUNTLY expresses his opinion that "<i>The Dancing
    Girl</i> will almost certainly be the play of the season; it
    will probably be the principal play of the year." "Almost
    certainly" and "probably" save the situation. The Baron backs
    <i>The Idler</i> against <i>The Dancing Girl</i> for a run. In
    the same Magazine Mr. ALBERT FLEMING has condensed into a short
    story, called <i>Sally</i>, material that would have served
    some authors for a three-volume novel.</p>

    <p>It is a pleasure for the Baron to be in perfect accord on
    any one point with the Author of <i>Essays in Little</i>, and
    in proportion to the number of the points so is the Baron's
    pleasure intensified. Most intending readers of these Essays,
    on taking up the book, would be less curious to ascertain what
    ANDREW LANG has to say about HOMER and the study of Greek,
    about THÉODORE BE BANVILLE, THOMAS HAYNES BAYLEY, the Sagas,
    and even about KINGSLEY, than to read his opinions on DICKENS
    and THACKERAY, placing DICKENS first as being the more popular.
    The Baron recommends his friends, then, to read these Essays of
    ANDREW's, beginning with THACKERAY, then DICKENS; do not, on
    any account, omit the delightfully written and truly
    appreciative article on CHARLES LEVER; after which, go as you
    please, but finish with "<i>the last fashionable novel</i>,"
    wherein our M.A., in his Merriest-Andrewest mood, treats us to
    an excellent parody.</p>

    <p>The Baron has appointed an extra Reader, and this
    Extra-Ordinary Reader to the Baron has just entered upon the
    discharge of his duties by reading <i>Monte Carlo, and How to
    Do It</i>, by W.F. GOLDBERG, and G. CHAPLIN PIESSE (J.W.
    ARROWSMITH). He reports in the following terms to his loved
    Chief:&mdash;This book achieves the task of combining
    extraordinary vulgarity with the flattest and most insipid
    dulness&mdash;not a common dulness, but a dulness redolent of
    low slang and dirty tap-rooms. The authors seem to plume
    themselves on their marvellous success in reaching Monte Carlo,
    which, with their usual sprightly facetiousness, they call
    "Charley's Mount." They are good enough to tell such of the
    travelling public as may want to get there, that the train
    leaving Victoria at 8.40 A.M. reaches Dover at 10.35.
    Stupendous! These two greenhorns took their snack on board the
    steamer (Ugh!), instead of waiting until they reached Calais,
    where there is the best restaurant on any known line. Instead
    of going by the <i>Ceinture</i>, they drove across Paris. The
    greenhorns arrive at Monte Carlo, and then settle on their
    quarters. Anyone but an idiot would have settled all this, and
    much more, beforehand. One gentlemanly greenhorn, who wishes us
    to think that "<i>il connait son Paris</i>," talks of "suppers
    of Bignon's" (which must be some entirely new dish), and
    informs us that, "at the Hôtel de l'Athenée, the staff esteem
    it rather a privilege, and a mark of their skill in language,
    to grin and snigger when sworn at in English." Oh, sweet and
    swearing British greenhorn! now I know why the French so
    greatly love our countrymen. But why, oh why do you imagine
    that you have discovered Monte Carlo? For the details of the
    journey, and the instructions to future explorers, are set out
    with a painful minuteness which not even STANLEY could rival.
    As for Monaco, dear, restful, old-fashioned, picturesque
    Monaco, whither the visitor climbs to escape from the glare and
    noise of Monte Carlo, the greenhorn dismisses it scornfully, as
    having "no interest." How much does this ten-per-center want?
    He "waggles along the Condamine;" he mixes with many who are
    "pebble-beached;" he speaks of his intimates as "Pa," "The
    Coal-Shunter," "Ballyhooly," &amp;c., and declares of the
    French soldier that "the short service forty-eight-day men
    don't have a very unkyperdoodlum time of it." There's wit for
    you, there's elegance! Then he becomes Jeromeky-jeromistically
    eloquent on the subject of fleas, throws in such lucid
    expressions as "chin music," "gives him biff," "his craft is
    thusly," and, altogether, proves himself and his
    fellow-explorer to be a couple of the slangiest and most
    foolish greenhorns who ever put pen to any sort of paper. I can
    imagine the readers who enjoy their stuff. Dull, swaggering,
    blatant, gin-absorbing, red-faced Cockneys, who masquerade as
    sportsmen, and chatter oaths all day. "Ditto to you," says the
    Baron to his Extra-Ordinary Reader, and backs his opinion with
    his signature,</p>

    <p>Dear EDITOR,&mdash;Noticing that the author of <i>The Doll's
    House</i> was to have another morning, or, to use an equally
    suitable epithet, mourning performance devoted to his works, I
    made up my mind, after bracing up my nerves, to attend it. The
    23rd of February (the date of the proposed function) as the
    second Monday in Lent, seemed to me, too, distinctly
    appropriate. By attending the performance&mdash;IBSEN
    recommends self-execution&mdash;I sentenced myself to three
    hours and a half of boredom, tempered with disgust. I cannot
    help feeling that whatever my past may have been, the penance
    paid to wipe it out was excessive, and therefore rendered it
    unnecessary that I should attend a second performance announced
    for last week.</p>

    <p><i>Rosmershölm</i> is in four Acts and one Scene&mdash;a
    room in <i>Rosmer's</i> House. Act I. <i>Rector Kroll</i>, who
    is the brother-in-law of <i>Pastor Rosmer</i>, calls upon the
    latter, to ask him to edit a paper in the Conservative
    interest. <i>Kroll</i> (who, by the way, is a married man)
    before seeing the widower of his dead sister, has a mild
    flirtation with <i>Rebecca West</i>, a female of a certain age,
    who has taken up her abode for some years in the Rector's
    house. And here I may observe that the Rector's housekeeper,
    <i>Madame Helseth</i>, presumably a highly respectable person,
    although she has excellent reasons, from the first, for
    believing that the relations between her Master and
    <i>Rebecca</i> are scarcely platonic, accepts the domestic
    arrangements of the Rosmer <i>ménage</i> with hearty
    acquiescence, not to say enthusiasm. <i>Rosmer</i> interrupts
    the Rector's <i>tête-à-tête</i> with the fascinating
    <i>Rebecca</i>, and declines the proffered editorship, because
    he is a Radical, and an atheist. End of Act I.,&mdash;no action
    to speak of, but a good deal of wordy twaddle. In Act II. we
    learn that the late <i>Mrs. Rosmer</i> has committed suicide,
    because she was informed that the apostate Pastor could only
    save his villainy from exposure by giving immediately the
    position of wife to her friend <i>Rebecca</i>. She has had this
    tip on the most reliable authority,&mdash;it has been furnished
    by <i>Rebecca</i> herself. Then the Pastor asks <i>Rebecca</i>
    to marry him, but is refused, for no apparent reason, unless it
    be that she has tired of her guilty passion. In Act III.
    <i>Rebecca</i> admits to the widower and his brother-in-law
    that she has deceived the deceased, and prepares to decamp. In
    the final Act the apostate Pastor declares that he has been in
    love with <i>Rebecca</i> from the first, loves her now, but is
    not sure that she loves him. To set his mind at rest on this
    point, will she do him a small favour? Will she be so good as
    to jump into the mill-stream, and drown herself? With
    pleasure&mdash;and she takes a header! He explains that
    courtesy forbids him to keep a lady waiting, and follows her
    example! So both are drowned, and all ends happily!</p>

    <p>And this is the plot! And what about the characters?
    <i>Rebecca</i> is merely a hysterical old maid, who would have
    been set right, in the time of the Tudors, with a sound
    ducking; and nowadays, had she consulted a fashionable
    physician, she would have been probably ordered a sea-voyage,
    and a diet free from stimulants. The Pastor is a feeble, fickle
    fool, who seemingly has had but one sensible idea in his life.
    He has believed his wife to be mad, and, considering that she
    married him, his faith in the matter rested upon evidence of an
    entirely convincing nature. The <i>Rector Kroll</i> is a prig
    and a bore of the first water. When he discovers
    <i>Rebecca's</i> perfidy, he suggests that she may have
    inherited her proneness for treachery from her
    father&mdash;and, to her distressed astonishment, he gives the
    name of a gentleman, not hitherto recognised by her as a
    parent! The best line in the piece, to my mind&mdash;and it
    certainly "went with a roar"&mdash;is a question of the
    housekeeper&mdash;answered in the negative&mdash;"Have you ever
    seen the Pastor laugh?" Laugh! with such surroundings!
    Pretentious twaddle, that would be repulsively immoral were it
    less idiotic. And <i>so</i> dull!</p>

    <p>As a theatre-goer for more than a quarter of a century, I
    dislike undue severity, and am consequently glad to find my
    opinion is shared by others. "SCRUTATOR," the Dramatic Critic
    of <i>Truth</i>, wrote last week&mdash;"The few independent
    persons who have sat out a play by IBSEN, be it <i>The Doll's
    House</i>, or <i>The Pillars of Society</i>, or
    <i>Rosmershölm</i>, have said to themselves. 'Put this stuff
    before the playgoing public, risk it at an evening theatre,
    remove your <i>claque</i>, exhaust your attendance of the
    socialist and the sexless, and then see where your IBSEN will
    be.' I have never known an audience that cared to pay to be
    bored, and the over-vaunted <i>Rosmershölm</i> bored even the
    Ibsenites." I only hope it did, for they deserve their
    martyrdom! I believe that you personally, my dear Editor, have
    never seen a dramatic performance of the "Master's" work. I
    wish I could say as much, and I shall be surprised if you do
    not appreciate the feeling, after you too have partaken of this
    truly Lenten fare. Yours sincerely,</p>

    <h2>WILDE FLOWERS.</h2>

    <p>Some other fellow, in the <i>P.M.G.</i>, has been beforehand
    with us in spotting "A Preface to <i>Dorian Gray</i>," by our
    OSCAR WILDE-r than ever, in this month's <i>Fortnightly. Dorian
    Gray</i> was published some considerable time ago, so it
    belongs to ancient history, and now, after this lapse of time,
    out comes the preface. And this "preface" occupies the better
    part, I use this expression in all courtesy, of two pages;
    which two pages represent a literary flowerbed, where rows of
    bright asterisks are planted between lines of brilliant
    aphorisms. The rule of the arrangement seems to be.&mdash;"when
    in doubt, plant asterisks." <i>Sic itur ad astra.</i> The
    garden is open to all, let us cull; here one and there one.
    "<i>To reveal Art and conceal the Artist, is Art's aim.</i>" Is
    there not in this the scent of "<i>Ars est celare artem</i>"?
    "Art" includes "the Artist," of course. Then "<i>Puris omnia
    pura</i>" is to be found in two other full-blown aphorisms, if
    I mistake not. St. PAUL's advice to TIMOTHY is engrafted on to
    the stalk of another aphorism. "Why lug in TIMOTHY?" Well, to
    "adapt" Scripture to one's purpose is not to quote it. <i>Vade
    retro!</i> Do we not recognise something familiar in "<i>When
    Critics disagree the Artist is in accord with himself?</i>"</p>

    <p>But after it is all done, and the little flower-show is
    over, then arises the despairing cry of our own cherished
    OSCAR. It is in the <i>Last of the Aphorisms</i>; after which,
    exhausted, he can only sign his name, fling away the
    goose-quill, and then sink back in his luxurious arm-chair
    exhausted with the mental efforts of years concentrated into
    the work of one short hour. Ah! "<i>La plupart des livres d'à
    présent ont l'air d'avoir été faits en un jour avec des livres
    lus de la veille.</i>" Ask Messrs. ROCHEFOUCAULD, CHAMFORT,
    RIVAROL, and JEAN MORLÉ. "<i>Ai! Ai! Papai! Papai!</i>
    Phillaloo! Murther in Irish!" Let us be natural, or shut up
    shop. Yet there is a chance,&mdash;to be supernatural. The
    great Pan is dead, so there is a seat vacant among the gods,
    open to any aspirant for immortality. "<i>All Art is quite
    useless!</i>" cries OSCAR WILDE-ly. And has it come to this?
    "Is this the Hend?" Yes, this is his last word&mdash;for the
    present. Pan is dead! <i>Vive</i> Pannikin!</p>

    <h3>REVELATIONS OF A REVELLER.</h3>

    <p>I revelled at the Albert Hall, which last week was given up
    to a festival called "<i>The Coming Race</i>." I was there at
    the opening on Thursday, the 5th, when Princess BEATRICE,
    attended by her husband, Prince HENRY of Battenberg, declared
    the Bazaar open. A gay and festive scene. Here, there, and
    everywhere, Egyptian houses made of cardboard, containing
    stalls full of the most useful articles imaginable. On the
    daïs, a number of sweet-faced ladies presenting purses
    (containing £3 3<i>s.</i> and upwards) to the Princess, who
    received them with an affability which won the hearts of all
    beholders. On the floor of the building was a gaily-dressed
    throng, which included many a distinguished person. The revelry
    continued for three days, and was, I trust, the means of
    obtaining funds for a charity which, no doubt, is most
    deserving of support. And here, I may say, I revelled so much
    at the Albert Hall, that I had no desire to revel anywhere
    else.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, March 2.</i>&mdash;Navy
    Estimates on to-night. Millions of money to be voted, and only
    fourteen Members present. One, it is true, is HARCOURT; so
    perhaps the most accurate enumeration of the aggregate would be
    fifteen.</p>

    <p>"<i>Que diable allait-il faire dans ce</i> jolly-boat?"
    GEORGE HAMILTON asks, pausing for a moment in his incessant
    occupation of tearing up strips of paper to glance across table
    at portly figure reclining on Front Opposition Bench. Several
    Admirals and Captains have spoken. Members generally have fled
    the burning deck. Even OLD MORALITY's sense of duty to his
    Queen and Country cannot restrain his flight; but CASABIANCA
    HARCOURT still remains. A little provoking for the Old Salts
    descanting on Naval affairs to observe smile of pitying
    toleration with which he listens. Doesn't <i>say</i> they're
    all wrong, but smiles it. Even the voice of the Reverberating
    COLOMB falters when, glancing round the great gaps of empty
    Benches opposite, his eye falls on HARCOURT.</p>

    <p>"Sir, I repeat," he said, quite angrily, though no one had
    contradicted him, "that during the period that has elapsed
    since commencement of the present reign, the revenue of the
    United Kingdom has increased only one-and-a-half times, while
    that of the outlying Empire has multiplied five-fold."</p>

    <p>General admission that HARCOURT is a master in nearly every
    department of human knowledge. Up to to-night fondly thought
    that at least he knew nothing about the Navy. But he does;
    knows more than Admiral FIELD, or Admiral MAYNE, or even
    Colonel GOURLEY. Presently rose and delivered slashing speech,
    laying low the Reverberating COLOMB as if he had been set up in
    the Place Vendôme; reviewing the British Fleet in masterly
    style; nimbly running up the mainmast and sighting Jerusalem
    and Madagascar, to the absolute confounding of the First Lord
    of the Admiralty.</p>

             height.

    <p>"Well," said KERANS, drawing himself up to something more
    than his full height, "that's the most remarkable exhibition I
    ever heard, even from HARCOURT. We've nothing like it on our
    side. HOWORTH knows a thing or two, and HANBURY isn't lacking
    in accomplishment; but for versatility, for profundity of
    knowledge, for readiness of grasp, whether the object be a
    lawyer's brief, a Chancellor of the Exchequer's ledger, the
    hilt of a sword, or the tiller of a ship, give me
    HARCOURT."</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Committee on the Navy
    Estimates.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;WOLMER asked OLD MORALITY what about
    the Fog? Couldn't something be done to lighten it, say by
    appointment of Royal Commission? OLD MORALITY beamed across
    House upon his young friend with expression of almost paternal
    solicitude. WOLMER is Whip of the allied force. What did he
    mean by suddenly springing this question on the First Lord of
    the Treasury? Was there more in it than met the eye? Had it
    something to do, however obscurely, with the maintenance of the
    Union?</p>

    <p>CHAMBERLAIN sat on the Front Bench opposite, staring
    straight into space with Sphynx-like countenance. HARTINGTON,
    with hat cunningly tipped over eyes, hid what secret may have
    lain far in their pellucid depths. HENRY JAMES became suddenly
    absorbed in the brown gaiters he has recently added to the
    graces of his personal appearance, in pathetic admission that
    the natural charms of youth are at length fading.</p>

    <p>Nothing to be gained by the inspection. If the cause of the
    Union really was at stake, the springs of motive were hidden
    behind the smiling countenance of the Machiavellian WOLMER. The
    only thing to do, and it is quite foreign to the habits of OLD
    MORALITY, was to meet guile with guile. WOLMER's question,
    plain enough as it appeared in print on the prosaic Orders,
    was, "Will Her Majesty's Ministers consider the advisability of
    appointing a Royal Commission to examine and report how far the
    evil of Fog is one that may be mitigated by legislation?"</p>

    <p>"Sir," said OLD MORALITY, rising to the occasion, "I have to
    assure my Noble Friend that Her Majesty's Government are, in
    common with other inhabitants of the Metropolis, extremely
    sensible of the serious injury, disturbance, and hardship
    inflicted by the increasing prevalence of fog. What, it may be
    asked, is the cause of the London fog? These fogs, which occur
    generally in the winter time, are occasioned thus: some current
    of air, being suddenly cooled, descends into the warm streets,
    forcing back the smoke in a mass towards the earth. But, my
    Noble Friend might ask, why are there not fogs every night? I
    will tell him, for this is a matter in which Her Majesty's
    Government have nothing to hide, or, I may add, to conceal. Our
    wish is to meet the convenience of Hon. Gentlemen in whatever
    part of the House they sit. Fogs&mdash;this I have no
    hesitation in stating&mdash;do not supervene without
    intermission on successive nights, because the air will always
    hold in solution a certain quantity of vapour which varies
    according to its temperature, and when the air is not
    saturated, it may be cooled without parting with its vapour.
    Yes, I know. My Right Hon. Friend, the Member
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"
       id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span> for West Birmingham, with
       his usual acumen&mdash;which I am sure we all
       recognise&mdash;asks me, In what circumstances do fogs occur
       at night? I am much obliged to him for reminding me of the
       point. Fogs happen at night, when the air has been saturated
       with vapour during the day. When this is the case, it
       deposits some of its superabundant moisture in the form
       known in rural districts&mdash;as my Hon. Friend, the Member
       for the Bordesley Division, is well aware&mdash;as dew. In
       the Metropolis it is more familiar as fog. This process of
       deposition commences as soon as the capacity of the air for
       holding vapour is lessened by the coldness of advancing
       night. I think I have now answered the question of my Noble
       Friend fully, and, I trust, frankly. He will, I am sure,
       upon consideration, see that this is not a matter with which
       a Royal Commission could be expected successfully to cope,
       and, therefore, I may add, Her Majesty's Government do not,
       after full consideration of their duty to the QUEEN and
       Country, think it desirable to adopt the suggestion thrown
       out by my Noble Friend."</p>

    <p>Dr. MAGEE, walking out Bishop of Peterborough, comes back
    Archbishop of York. The ceremony of their installation not
    nearly so comic as that of ordinary Peers of Parliament. Garter
    King-at-Arms does not appear; nor Black Rod; nor is there any
    game of Follow-my-leader round the Benches.</p>

    <p>"No, no," said the MARKISS, who Mr. G. quite unjustly says
    has no strain of reverence in his disposition, "that would
    never do. Must be careful with our Bishops."</p>

    <p>So the three new-comers, having paid their respects to the
    LORD-CHANCELLOR, straightway took their seats on the Episcopal
    Bench, folded their hands over their surpliced knees, and lent
    an added air of peace and purity to the precincts.</p>

    <p>DENMAN bustling about, weighed down with cares of State. Had
    promised to bring into Lords ATKINSON's Muffin-Bell Bill,
    limiting duration of Speeches. But Bill stuck in the Commons,
    whilst ATKINSON turned his attention to his Dowagers Bill.</p>

    <p>"ATKINSON's a good fellow," said DENMAN. "Have sometimes
    thought an alliance between him and me, a sort of coalition
    between two estates of the realm, might work great things. But
    I'm beginning to lose confidence in him. At certain periods of
    the lunar month he's too comprehensive in his legislative
    ambition. Why wasn't he content with his Muffin-Bell Bill? Why
    drag in the Dowager? These Dowagers, dear TOBY, have, if I may
    say so&mdash;using the phrase strictly in Parliamentary
    sense&mdash;got their arms round the neck of my friend
    ATKINSON, and will pull him down. It's a pity, for I think,
    between us, we could have put things straight generally."</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;PHILIPPE EGALITÉ very rarely troubles
    House with ordered speech. A good deal on his mind looking
    after JACOBY, and keeping the Party straight. But his silence
    doesn't arise from incapacity to speak. This shown to-night in
    his speech on Railway Rates and Charges. Full of good matter,
    admirably delivered. After this, Dr. CLARK proposed to discuss
    Home Rule; but House didn't seem to care about it particularly.
    So at Half-past Eight was Counted Out. This was the chief

    <h3>THE FINE YOUNG GERMAN EMPEROR.</h3>

    <h4>(<i>A New Song to an Old Tune.</i>)</h4>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>I'll sing to you a brand new song, made by a modern
            pate,</p>

            <p>Of a fine young German Emperor, an Oracle of
            State,</p>

            <p>Who kept up his autocracy at the bountiful old
            rate,</p>

            <p>With the aid of Socialism for the poor men at his
            gate;</p>

            <p class="i6">This fine young German Emperor, all of
            the modern time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>His ancestors had "kept their fingers on the pulse
            of time"</p>

            <p>(He said), and he'd do ditto in a fashion more
            sublime;</p>

            <p>For, as BACON said of Nature, he who'd rule her must
            obey.</p>

            <p>And that with modern "tendency," is the new imperial
            way,</p>

            <p class="i6">Of this fine young German Emperor,
            &amp;c.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>He'd "mastered the new Spirit," which (how kind!)
            "he'd not oppose."</p>

            <p>Social reform or Education <i>he</i>'d not treat as
            foes,</p>

            <p>But keep step with the "Tendencies" which else might
            trip his toes,</p>

            <p>And thus he'd "head the movement," and would lead it
            (by the nose?),</p>

            <p class="i6">This fine young German Emperor,
            &amp;c.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Now surely this is better far than all the old

            <p>Of tyranny in mufti, and of greed in masquerade;</p>

            <p>And of this young German Emperor, whatever may be
            said,</p>

            <p>Or of his new vagaries, you'll allow <i>he knows his

            <p>Who Ancient Order patronise, and Modern Style
            oppose.</p>

            <p>Particularly one Old Man, who plainly did not
            see</p>

            <p>Laying down his long-held power, and submitting
            tranquilly</p>

            <p class="i6">To this fine young German Emperor,
            &amp;c.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p><i>He</i> was no CINCINNATUS, and he did not love
            the plough,</p>

            <p>So he talked, inspired the Papers, and, in fact,
            roused lots of row.</p>

            <p>For this man of Blood and Iron, when thus laid upon
            the shelf,</p>

            <p>Found that long control of others did <i>not</i>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Then this fine young German Emperor, who aims to
            lead the dance,</p>

            <p>Has a very trying <i>vis-à-vis</i>, that fractious
            dame, <i>La France</i>,</p>

            <p>To keep step with that lady, without treading on her
            train,</p>

            <p>Would tax Terpsichore herself; <i>he</i> finds the
            effort vain;</p>

        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>So this fine young German Emperor has got a stiffish
            task,</p>

            <p>That all his strength will occupy, and all his tact
            will task.</p>

            <p>Let us wish him patriot wisdom, <i>and</i> respect
            for Elder Fame,</p>

            <p>And then he'll give his country peace, and leave a
            noble name,</p>

            <p class="i6">This fine young German Emperor, all of

    <h3>A ROUGH CROSSING.</h3>

    <p>That military-looking gentleman, with his arm in a sling,
    and his head covered with bandages, has, I suppose, just
    returned from fighting the Dacoits in Upper Burmah?</p>

    <p>I certainly <i>am</i> surprised when you inform me that he
    has only tried to cross a London street in a fog.</p>

    <p>Do you really mean to say that the vehicle that just
    thundered past at twenty miles an hour, in the mist, was
    <i>not</i> a fire-engine, but only a covered Van?</p>

    <p>Yes, I believe it <i>is</i> a fact that special beds in all
    the Hospitals are now reserved for Van-victims.</p>

    <p>Of course it is difficult for a man in the Van to look to
    the Rear; still he need not swoop down on pedestrians quite so
    much like a highwayman, saying, "Your collar-bone or your
    life!"</p>

    <p>If things go on as they are now doing, every covered Van
    will have to carry its own Surgeon and ambulance about with
    it.</p>

    <p>What is that crowd for, and why is somebody shouting
    angrily? Oh, I suppose the old gentleman, who has been run over
    by the Coal-waggon and is lying bleeding on the asphalte, is
    remonstrating with the driver?</p>

    <p>What? Can it really be the case that the driver is abusing
    the old gentleman for his stupidity in getting in his way?</p>

    <p>I <i>have</i> heard that the Insurance Companies now insert
    in their policies a condition forbidding the crossing of any
    street in London, except under police escort.</p>

    <p>And, finally, as nearly six thousand persons were run down
    in the streets of the Capital last year, is it not almost time
    that something were done to check the Van Mazeppa-Juggernaut in
    his wild career?</p>

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
